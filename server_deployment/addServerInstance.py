    Launch an instance and wait for it to start running.
    Returns a tuple consisting of the Instance object and the CmdShell
    object, if request, or None.

    ami        The ID of the Amazon Machine Image that this instance will
               be based on.  Default is a 64-bit Amazon Linux EBS image.

    instance_type The type of the instance.

    key_name   The name of the SSH Key used for logging into the instance.
               It will be created if it does not exist.

    key_extension The file extension for SSH private key files.
    
    key_dir    The path to the directory containing SSH private keys.
               This is usually ~/.ssh.

    group_name The name of the security group used to control access
               to the instance.  It will be created if it does not exist.

    ssh_port   The port number you want to use for SSH access (default 22).

    cidr       The CIDR block used to limit access to your instance.

    tag        A name that will be used to tag the instance so we can
               easily find it later.

    user_data  Data that will be passed to the newly started
               instance at launch and will be accessible via
               the metadata service running at http://169.254.169.254.

    cmd_shell  If true, a boto CmdShell object will be created and returned.
               This allows programmatic SSH access to the new instance.

    login_user The user name used when SSH'ing into new instance.  The
               default is 'ec2-user'

    ssh_passwd The password for your SSH key if it is encrypted with a
               passphrase.
